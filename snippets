// snippet is a shortcut which contains some codes written for your easy and fast use. just type you snippet code that you have set and get your desire ready made code for fast use
// it helps to do programming faster
// Following are the steps to set your snippets 

// how to set your snippets in vs code  
// go to setting in your left corner in vs code 
// click on that and then you will see user snippets option
// if you dont see it then try installing extenion for snippets
// for that simply search for snippets in extenion menu

// after you click on user snippets option
// you will find different option to set snippets for like c c++ etc. 
// there is a option like (New global snippet file) where you can set snippets for all programming like c c++ python etc
// for now i will click on the option (New global snippet file) 
// it will ask for your snippets file name. Name your snippets file 
//  Then something like the following will occur.


{
	// Place your global snippets here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a scope, prefix, body and 
	// description. Add comma separated ids of the languages where the snippet is applicable in the scope field. If scope 
	// is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is 
	// used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are: 
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. 
	// Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	// "Print to console": {
	// 	"scope": "javascript,typescript",
	// 	"prefix": "log",
	// 	"body": [
	// 		"console.log('$1');",
	// 		"$2"
	// 	],
	// 	"description": "Log output to console"
	// }
}

now go to website    https://snippet-generator.app/
type code that you want to set as snippets

NOTE: please give a unique prefix name for your snippets so that you can easily get it when you type it in your source code terminal or file.

on right side click on copy snippet
paste this on the vs code inside curly braces like the following


{
	// Place your global snippets here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a scope, prefix, body and 
	// description. Add comma separated ids of the languages where the snippet is applicable in the scope field. If scope 
	// is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is 
	// used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are: 
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. 
	// Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	// "Print to console": {
	// 	"scope": "javascript,typescript",
	// 	"prefix": "log",
	// 	"body": [
	// 		"console.log('$1');",
	// 		"$2"
	// 	],
	// 	"description": "Log output to console"
	// }
  
  // Paste your code here
  
}



now go to your source code and write the prefix name of the snippets that you have set (see you snippets code what word you have set as prefix)
after writing that word option will come then simply click on that or enter 

Your code will be written automatically which you have set as snippets or shortcut

Thank you!!!
